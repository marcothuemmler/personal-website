  Hi! I'm Marco, a junior full-stack software engineer and passionate tech enthusiast.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  I recently graduated from Constance University of Applied Sciences with my B.Sc., where I studied Applied Computer
  Science with a specialization in software engineering. During my studies, I had the opportunity to apply my skills
  during internships, gaining valuable insights and further nurturing my passion for the field.

  In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, kayaking, traveling, and hiking. I also love tinkering with various
  computer-related projects, from flashing a custom REST server onto a smart lightbulb, over experiments with OpenWrt on
  my
  personal router, to hosting my own services on my home lab Raspberry Pi. Last but not least, I like to engage in
  small
  Arduino projects for fun. Overall, I'm pretty curious about any- and everything relating to computers.
